Fashion-Savvy Online Shopper and Browser wanted for Vintage Resale Business,Marketing,"Hey there, fashionista! 👋

Do you love shopping for clothes and have an eye for undervalued items that could be worth more? Are you passionate about the world of design and fashion, and interested in working for a vintage resale business? If so, we're looking for someone just like you!

Within your function, you'll be responsible for sourcing vintage clothing and accessories, and spotting unique pieces that could be sold for a higher price. You should love browsing through items and ideally know something about designer clothes and handbags. Please note that good English skills are needed since a bit of negotiation will be part of the work since you’ll be negotiating with sellers. Additionally, minor knowledge of Google Sheets will be helpful as you'll be keeping track of your finds and inventory. 🛍️

You'll also be working with a supportive boss (yours truly 😉) who will help you grow and develop your skills. If you're someone who is detail-oriented, highly organized, and has great style, then I want to hear from you! 🙌

And don't worry if you don't have a lot of prior experience in the vintage resale industry. I’ll provide you with all the training and support you need to excel in your role.

Can't wait to hear from you,

GoHighLevel/Systeme.io/Kartra expert required,Marketing,"Hi,

I need to build a high-quality sales automation process. 

I've built an online analysis tool that creates an interactive report and dashboard for managers on how their team works and functions. It's all about generating insights and actions to increase team cohesion and morale while reducing stress - the end game is to boost team performance and productivity.

www.teamlytica.com

My main product is the Team report but I have other things to promote:
- Demo session - free
- Accreditation workshop - paid
- Team development day workshop - paid
- Team360 report - paid
- Benchmark report - paid

I need:
- Funnel pages - to find affiliates and for them to promote to their customers
- Email sequencing
- Diary booking
- Payments
- CRM
- Linking to Linkedin, my diary and email etc
- Potential for other free or paid downloads
- Affiliate management - their own landing pages, payments, bookings etc 

I'm sure there is a lot I've missed - and your experience and expertise need to fill in all the blanks 


Step 1. 
I need you to recommend which platform would suit me best. I'm happy to jump on a call and discuss my needs in more detail. GoHighLevel, Systeme.io, and Kartra are front runners but happy to look at others.

Step2. 
Map out the entire process. 

Step 3.
Build the system - phased is OK as I won't need everything all at once.
I'll provide the main copy but happy for you to add your experience in what works

Step 4.
Test and improve - this might lead to ongoing work

Notes:

I have a funnel page and some email sequences already set up in Kartra which can be used for reference. Kartra is not my preferred choice but I can be convinced.

I have lots of collateral, images, colors, logos, etc which should make the job much easier.

I'm after proactivity at every stage.

Keeping it simple will save time and money and allow further development going forward

Timescales:
I would look to start building around the 10th of April
It would be good to have it completed within 4 weeks - not a deal breaker though as long as progress is being made

Please do not call me directly as I like to place all work through Upwork.

I'm looking forward to doing great work with you.

Director Marketing Officer,Marketing,"Qualifications:

PLEASE NOTICE: All of the conditions and characteristics listed below must be met in order for us to evaluate your application.

-Extremely ambitious individual

-2+ YEARS EXPERIENCE WITH FACEBOOK ADVERTISING (no other mastery of ad platforms is required)

-Deep experience and expertise of the entire marketing picture, conversion rate, creatives, advertorials, and so on...

We are not looking for someone to just handle our advertisements!

-Perfect English is essential.

-Not associated with any other brand/project; we are only looking for someone who will be completely dedicated to us.

-Being available 7 days a week and prepared to work 200-250 hours per month is required. Please read ""Working Hours and Time Availability"" for more information.



PLEASE DO NOT APPLY IF YOU DO NOT MEET ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS AND CHARACTERS.




Job time and time availability:

We demand 7 days per week availability and around 200-250 working hours per month; however, one day per week will be a part-time day (2-4 hours). That will be your ""off"" day, and all you will need to do is check and turn off a few advertising, essentially simply maintain.

Why do we require his complete availability? Since, especially at the start, there will be a lot to set up, but as time goes on and there is less to do, or when we employ someone to help you (for example, a media buyer), we may gradually reduce the working hours. Nonetheless, we simply want to make it obvious that we are looking for someone who genuinely cares about his or her work.




The Industry:

We are a 100% remote firm with around 15 employees situated in Italy.
Our crew is made up of one-third Italians and two-thirds Filipinos.
Our warehouse is in Italy and is totally handled by a logistic center; we do not drop ship and instead operate on an inventory basis.
The bulk of our purchases are paid on delivery rather than online (currently 95% of transactions are COD), which is our primary emphasis and competitive advantage.

Our ambition is to become the world's largest COD e-commerce company. And to make the purchase of any commodity available to everyone, using any payment option, particularly cash on delivery. All while offering a diverse product line, outstanding customer service, and quick shipment.


(Further information about our organization will be provided in the following phase of the employment process)



The Role:

You will be in charge of the following as a CMO:


-Managing our Facebook advertisements (high level expertise is required)
-Overseeing our Google and Tiktok advertisements (in this case we do not require any previous experience or expertise)
-Overseeing the creation of all of our advertisements across all ad platforms (not the creation, just the ideation as we have 4 full time graphic designers executing, and we will hire a video editor as soon as we need him)
-Managing the whole funnel ideation and execution, including anything related to increasing profitability for our best sellers, testing different landing pages to enhance CR, trying new angles, testing advertorials, etc....basically everything that will provide a greater return on our ad spend.

These are the primary basic items for which you will be responsible; however, we may add a few additional things in the future if necessary.

Note: a more detailed explanation will be provided in the next step of the hiring process, but to put it simply, I, the founder, am looking for someone who can really help grow this business and handle everything marketing-related, so that I can focus on ops, hr, and the rest, which is my strongest suit.




Remuneration:

The remuneration will be made up of a predetermined hourly wage plus a profit share.
Even though this will be discussed in further depth in the following phase, you may expect a salary ranging from 4000 USD per month to 10000 USD per month (with acceptable KPI achievement).
(Please note:The large wage range is purely determined by the profit share, which is planned to be exponential, as are our earnings, with a greater blended roas.

Project Manager Needed for SEO and Web Design Company,Marketing,"I own a small agency focusing on SEO and Website Design. I have been in business since 2013 and have needed a good project manager for quite some time. I have a few people to manage and delegate tasks that are mostly freelancers. Website jobs run smoothly but could be faster and SEO projects do well with results, but we lack in communicating with clients regularly and staying on task with deliverables. 

Here is a breakdown of responsibilities I foresee:

**Website Projects** 
-Collect all necessary details from the client to kick off the project such as design ideas, logo, images, content, example sites they like, logins to hosting accounts, etc.

- Communicate with our designer / web developer on the project details and make sure they understand. 

- Check on project and preview the work before the link is sent to the client for review.

- Schedule meeting with the client to review the site and take down notes of changes needed in order to give those edits to the developer.

- Once Design is approved, we will go through a pre-launch checklist and then push it live. 

**SEO Project**
- You must be able to understand SEO in order to communicate factually with the client. (I will provide knowledge on this)

- Setup project in Project Management system. We use Flowlu which is similar to Asana and others. We would already have a template set up to apply to the project. You would be responsible for adding the task template and assigning tasks to the appropriate people.

- Send weekly emails to each client as a follow up on the project (This will cut down on calls and emails from clients.)

- Setup Clients in SEMRush for Keyword Tracking reports to be sent each month. (This will also have a summary section where we can add notes about completed tasks)

- Monthly meetings with some clients to discuss progress, reassure them we are on top of things, remind them SEO takes several months. (I will teach you how to show them KPIs that they can see to ease their mind. SEO client management is really about making them remain patient while we work. Most accounts take 8 months to 12 months for clients to start seeing a return. We tell them this upfront but they forget after 3 months it seems)

**Traits I am looking for in a project manager**
-Must be organized

-Honesty with clients. We can share with them if something negative happens and assure them we will be on top of it. Its always better for us to tell them rather than them find out another way. They will always trust us even if its some bad news here and there.

-You must be a people person. Be friendly, build a relationship thats not all business all the time. We are laid back here and many clients have become friends. 

- Dont oversell anything. We are honest with people and make no promises. Some project managers just go too far and make promises to clients just to avoid confrontation. We like to work through confrontation and make things right on both sides. 

- Confidence is crucial. You need to be confident in what we do so that on any calls with clients, they here were are confident. I have personally had projects that were doing poor for months and I would let them know we will work hard on moving in the right direction and that we just need some time as this is not an exact science. 99% of the time we are right on and the project is a success. Once a clients sees results, they hardly ever email us with any questions or complaints. 

Currently we have about 30 SEO clients I estimate that half need a 30 min meeting each month and the other half are lower budgets that only need email updates. 

I think we have enough work for about 20 hours per week right now, but this will free me up so much to finish another referral channel. I estimate we could hire you for 40 hours per week in the next 3-4 months.",Sales & Marketing,Sales & Marketing,Agile Project Management,Digital Project Management,Task Creation,Customer Development,Total Quality Management,Business with 1-9 Employees,Project Plans,Project Timelines,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,11.00211651,16,3.218875825,,16,8,Business development,Project Management,"SEMrush, Other"

Warehouse principles,Marketing,"The principles of warehouse management refer to a set of guidelines that ensure efficient and effective operations in a warehouse or distribution center. These principles include:

Inventory management: This principle involves tracking inventory levels, monitoring stock levels, and ensuring that inventory is properly labeled and stored.

Space utilization: Effective warehouse management requires the efficient use of space. This involves organizing the layout of the warehouse in a way that maximizes the use of space while ensuring that items are easily accessible.

Equipment and technology: The use of advanced technology and equipment such as warehouse management systems (WMS), barcoding, automated storage, and retrieval systems (ASRS), and conveyor belts are essential in achieving an efficient and effective warehouse.

Staff management: A well-trained and motivated workforce is essential for successful warehouse management. This includes the recruitment of qualified personnel, regular training, and provision of a safe working environment.

Safety and security: Ensuring the safety and security of goods and personnel within the warehouse is of utmost importance. Safety measures such as fire suppression systems, emergency lighting, and exit signs are important, while security measures such as surveillance cameras, access controls, and security personnel help protect against theft and vandalism.

Customer service: The warehouse is an important link in the supply chain, and providing excellent customer service is critical in maintaining customer satisfaction. Timely and accurate order fulfillment, accurate tracking, and on-time delivery are some of the key elements of customer service in a warehouse setting.

By following these principles, a warehouse can optimize its operations, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and ultimately provide better service to its customers.",Facebook,,Instagram,Content Writing,Social Media Advertising,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,10,,8,BI and Analytics,Data Engineering,Other

WHAT I DO
Neurodivergent people experience, interpret, and interact with the world in unique ways that are different, not less. Because the world is not designed for them, daily life is often more difficult due to neurological differences that influence communication, sensory processing, executive functioning, and learning.

Despite their many strengths, they often end up with chronic frustration and an alphabet soup of diagnoses that leave them feeling broken. As a life coach to both neurodivergent adults and their parents, I help turn that around through self-understanding, goal setting, and skill building to help them thrive. I’m part teacher, part mentor, part cheerleader, and part accountability partner.

MEET PATTY
I am a coach, educator, author, and speaker on the topic of neurodiversity. I understand the impact of being neurodivergent in a world built for neurotypicals. I come from the neurodiversity perspective, and I also acknowledge the challenges differences can pose to daily living.

In my coaching practice, I am an autism life skills and parent coach with both personal and professional experience with neurodiversity. I help autistic teens, adults, and their parents develop understanding, set and achieve goals, acquire skills, and ultimately thrive. I provide coaching sessions via Zoom with clients worldwide.

Every neurodivergent person possesses a unique set of strengths and weaknesses. We collaborate to identify their top goals and figure out which strengths can be leveraged while also identifying and overcoming any barriers that may be in the way of reaching their goals. Each coaching plan I develop is as personalized as my clients are unique.

My mission is to empower my clients to become their own best coaches and coach myself out of a job. To learn more about me, you can find my LinkedIn profile here.

Cost of Acquisition Specialist: Payment Processing Industry,Marketing,"Good day.

We are a B2B sales operation currently selling the ERC tax credit. With it ending in 6 to 8 months we are building out a new product launch of selling white-labeled Credit Card & Payment Processing to small and mid-size businesses.

With that, we are trying to develop our go-to-market strategy and financial model. We are looking to hire experienced marketing and go-to-market strategies that could help us first determine the cost to acquire a warm lead and an estimated cost of acquisition based on reasonable assumptions. 

Once we have developed a base understanding of estimated cost including a breakdown for different marketing channels then moving into a go-to-market strategy would be the next step.

Deliverables:
- Research documenting a confident estimate of the cost to produce inbound leads from different marketing channels
- Research documenting the feasibility of capturing these warm leads
- A plan of execution to go to market based on these gained insights.

We are a small-scale B2B sales operation currently selling the ERC. It ends in around 8 months and with that, we are exploring new products to sell to small to mid-size businesses. We are currently exploring Credit Card and Payment Processing as a new product.

We are setting up all the infrastructure to do so but we are wanting a specialist that can research the space and create 5-10 unique ways to offer this either to general small and mid-size businesses or an offer that would be attractive to specific niches.

We currently get most of our clientele through direct calling and SMS marketing. We still plan on doing this but also adding in some media buying to generate warm leads but need assistance coming up with the bait we are going to use to get them into our business to be sold. 

If you have experience crafting unique and attractive offers or developing unique ways to position an existing product. This project is perfect for you.

Deliverables:
- 5 to 10 unique ways to offer credit card processing to business owners that will attract them to our business
- Research to help us understand how you came up with these and the opportunity you see behind them
- Potential niches you see the most opportunity to target with payment processing.

We can provide some competitor data to help begin the process.

3) If you can find an email then also check out the picture on the website to get a sense of what they build and mark it in the template.

Two things to note
- We are looking for 25uniqie firms, if there is a direct or and an associate, please capture both in 2 lines but that only counts as 1 of the 25
- A generic email (e.g., info@company.com) does not count. We need personal emails

If performed well, hopefully will lead to more work! Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks!

Customer acquisition for Ontario Craft Brewer,Marketing,"Hey! Thanks for checking out the project.

We are an Ontario based craft brewery, currently expanding our reach across the province. Using freelancer's on Upwork is a great way to leverage talents and perspectives outside of our current team, and that's where you come in. 

The immediate task itself is quite straight forward; we've had success with our methods, scripts and prioritizing of prospects but we just need to be able to make more calls!

Upon acceptance of the job, you'll get;
- simple script and workflow
- simple data to collect (ie, contact name and any applicable notes in Excel)
- no responsibility to manage orders/shipping/invoice etc.

Again, this is just the immediate task, but there are many more that we would love to be able to hire for.

Upon acceptance, we can send over the files you need to get started right away, and/or hop on a call to clarify any questions you may have!

Looking for a marketing expert to sell online course,Marketing,"Hello,

I am looking for a marketing expert that can help me sell my online course.

The course is all about branding, meant for entrepreneurs, and in the $500 price range. It is available online and since its launch in 2020 I have done below the minimum in marketing and advertising it (only got 4 students).

I am looking for someone who can help with some (if not all) of the following:
- Review and edit the sales page
- Review the content to ensure the course and landing page deliver on the promises (you will gain free access to the course for this)
- Provide suggestions for pricing, content, and audience changes to make more sales
- Create any and all marketing materials
- Take full control over the marketing aspects (I do not want to be involved in this at all after the initial push)
- Regular status reports and updates (I want to see where my money is going)
- Long-term marketing plans, goals, and outlines

Please note: while I do have Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn accounts, I *do not use them*. If social media is a big part of your marketing plan, please take into consideration that I will not be active on these platforms and that I have a very small following on them. 

In addition, I do have a very small mailing list on FloDesk that is meant for *information purposes only* so I do not market to them. If email marketing is required, that will be starting from 0 subscribers! 

When it comes to budget, I have no idea what to aim for but I will gather the funds required for the right person (the higher the quote, the longer the wait), though I'm hoping we could do long-term marketing on a commission basis after the initial push (percentage negotiable). 

This is not for a sale or special event or anything.

If you're interested in this project, let me know about your experience in marketing online courses and your timeframe, process, the tools you regularly use, and your quote (please include ads spent in your quote).

Thank you,

SEO Expert - Knowledge of Local SEO- No Agencies,Marketing,"I'm looking for a local SEO expert to help me with a few things. I started in SEO 13 years ago but have been focused on paid ads for the last few years and haven't kept up with changes. 

I have clients asking about SEO services, and I would like to be able to offer SEO services to them, and I'm too busy to take on the work myself. 

 We are building a new website for a client, and he wants SEO services, so this would be the first project. 

This is what I would like: 

- To get a quote on this project and audit their current rankings
- Get an understanding of the best-ranking software/reporting to use
- What is the current best way to handle directories? (Manually or with a tool like Yext) 
- How much ongoing work is there? 
- Are links still important? 
- Does content marketing work for local businesses? 

I like to work with people who are intelligent/skilled, driven, organized, and good communicators. If you check those boxes, I'm very easy to work with. 

I am looking for someone with at least five years of experience and who has worked on over 20 accounts/companies. 

If the first project goes well, I'll have other interested clients. 

Please tell me why you think it would be a good fit.

Account Manager,Marketing,"Hello!

This is a contract-to-hire position with our company. We are a boutique digital marketing agency primarily focused in offering clients SEO services, paid search management and web design / development. 

While we have a team in place to handle the execution of client requests, we're want to improve our communication with clients and make sure we're delivering on expectations. While this role doesn't need to be incredibly technical, it would be great if you are familiar with digital marketing and website management.

LinkedIn & Company Website Research And Contact List Generation,Marketing,"Hi!

TASK:  
I have a list of ~150 companies that I will provide to you in Excel.  I am seeking someone to find employee names and contact info at these companies based on employee titles.

Titles include:
CFO
Asset Manager
Portfolio Manager
* Finance * or * Investments *

Note that with 150 companies and ~four contacts each, this is roughly 600 contacts for which I am seeking contact info which would be dropped into the excel file I provide.

For each individual contact, the contact info I'd ideally like:
Contact name
Contact LinkedIn hyperlink
Contact hyperlink (if available) to the individual on the company web page as typically found on links to ""Employees"", ""About Us"", etc
A contact email address which has been verified
Contact business phone number

In addition, for each company, I'd like the company's LinkedIn page hyperlink, and the company website hyperlink dropped into fields of the excel page.

ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENTS:
While this is a one-off project, if this works well, similar assignments will be available.  

PAST EXPERIENCE:  
While past commercial real estate experience is NOT required for this assignment, please highlight if you are familiar with job titles and functions within the commercial real estate industry as this may be useful in future projects.

OUTPUT:
Expected delivery of contact info is in an excel sheet but  I am open to other ideas.  Sample Excel file attached.  The green fields are the Company Names that I will provide, and the orange fields are the data I'd like you to collect.  The address is so that if there is more than one person with a given title, you can select someone closest to the address.  It is likely that not all Companies can be found and that some titles at given companies will not exist.

FLEXIBILITY:  
I am open to format changes if it makes the assignment easier for you (as I am more interested in complete and accurate content than formatting).  Also open to discussion about change in content scope.

TIMING:
Ideally would like delivery within five business days but have some flexibility.  I feel like this can be done relatively independently, but happy to answer questions along the way.",Researcher,,LinkedIn,Company Research,Data Entry,Virtual Assistant,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,8,0,250,,13,Business Development,Data Engineering,"Excel, LinkedIn, Other"

3. Develop a plan to implement the selected automation solution and estimate the timeline and resources required.

4. Test the automation solution to ensure data accuracy and completeness.

5. Train our team members on how to use and maintain the new automated process.

2. Areport/ agreed project scope, detailing the identified automation options and the selected solution.

3. A detailed plan for the implementation of the selected automation solution.

Budget:

Our budget for this project is flexible, and we are willing to consider a range of quotes based on the scope and complexity of the automation solution.

Email marketing expert for online guitar school,Marketing,"Hi, 

I own a local guitar school and an online guitar academy. 
I am needing help with some email marketing for the online academy. 

There are 2 specific projects I am needing help with. 

1. I have an email automation where where i give tips and tricks which is nurture sequence.  I've got about 30 emails. The first email is great, people love it but as the sequence goes I don't think it is very engaging getting people to buy from me. 

2. I am preparing to do an official launch of my Gamified Guitar Academy on social media and to my list and i don't want it to FLOP.
- content is the result of over 10,000hrs of in person lessons
- I launched in 2019 with my local students where i have been working out the kinks. 
- I have my own propriety teaching pedagoy that simultaneously builds the students skills, knowledge and creativity
- I have incredible success stories and results from it
- i have GAMIFIED the entire thing so students get points for everything so they can see how all their skills are coming together 

Check it our here www.guitargpsmethod.com

Because i have worked so hard in developing this (and running my local school) i haven't been promoting it. 

This is where i need an expert to help me great a buzz for this. 

I have developers who know my system well so i wouldn't need you do build out the automations which will make things much easier for you! I just need strategy and copy.

Need Facebook Ads Expert for Generating Insurance Leads,Marketing,"Hello. I run a digital agency that focuses on selling leads for insurance agents. We've been currently outsourcing the fullfillment to another company, but desperately want to bring on another media buyer for our other clients or just replace them completely. 

I am looking for someone who is an expert with Facebook who can consistently generate leads for insurance agents using Facebook Lead Ads.

HUGE PLUS:  If you have plenty of experience already working with insurance agents or similar positions, so you have proven templates, ads, formulas that you know can consistently get results.

The insurance industry does have some regulation/compliance, so that's why I'm really ideally looking for someone who already knows the market and how to get MASSIVE results.

Haven't worked with insurance agents but have a lot of experience in lead gen? Feel free to reach out still even if most of your experience has been with things like construction, hvac, lawyers, solar, etc.

Please answer the following questions:

#1 - if you've worked for insurance agents - What's been your average CPL.

#2 - What type of details/data do you collect for leads?

#3 - Can you show me samples of your work?

#4 - What is your price?

#5 - if all goes well, would you be open to working full-time with me (is there a set $$ / mo you would want to make in order to consider it?)

-Engagement with accounts who follow similar brands / creators to bring attention to my page. 
-Increase 500 followers organically ASAP, without ""follow for follow""
-Create a list of brands I could reach out to about collaboration or booking shoots
-Finding worthwhile TFP product shoots if they exist (I am not open to shooting for free unless it's an opportunity I can't pass up)
-Help with posting strategies and timing to get the most engagement 
-Research and make a list of viable magazines to publish our work, in print or on Instagram. You could find these through the Insta platform or via Kavyar (though I am looking for someone who can vet the magazines on there, many are not legit and don't even have a following)

What I do NOT want you to do -
-Post for me
-Write and post stories without my approval
-Respond to messages

I have a very specific ideas about what work I want shared and the overall look of my feed. I am totally open to ideas and suggestions but because I am particular about aesthetics, and because this is also my personal page, I do not want anyone posting on my behalf. Writing comments to other people + brands on other peoples' pages though is great.

I am NOT an ""influencer"" and do not want to be perceived as attempting these tactics as I personally find most of them distasteful so I am approaching this very carefully and organically as possible, so the person I am working with needs to understand that. This is not a job for every social media marketer out there. Please make a note of your understanding of this in your proposal otherwise I will move on to the next.

Ho una vita molto presa, ho diversi progetti che sto sviluppando e mi ritrovo spesso senza tempo. Una di queste attività, ovvero quella di tuo interesse, è la mia “Agenzia di marketing”. Da ormai anni aiuto diverse aziende leader in Italia nel loro settore ad aumentare margini e profitti e devo dire che va piuttosto bene.

Questo perché offro un servizio che in pochi in italia possono dare: garantire risultati, altrimenti è gratis.

In soldoni, ricerco aziende ad alto potenziale e successivamente le aiuto a crescere velocemente, senza chiedere un centesimo se non porto risultati.

Se da un lato dunque ci sono molte possibilità anche di guadagno, dall’altra c’è la difficoltà di dover gestire tutti i progetti. Sì, perché non sono in pochi a richiedermelo (proprio per la mia garanzia totale).

Sto quindi cercando una figura che mi aiuti a:

1. Ricercare talenti

Sì, perché se troviamo aziende interessanti che sono appena partite e, ovviamente, noi facciamo il nostro lavoro, tutti ne beneficiamo. 

Il goal sarebbe essere sempre più bravi a trovare quelle aziende che partono da zero ma con belle prospettive.

2. Gestione della comunicazione e dell’aspetto operativo

Lavorando con aziende che partono da zero, spesso non hanno team, dunque dobbiamo essere in grado di creare un’offerta ad hoc, un sito e scrivere i vari copy. Le mansioni saranno esattamente queste.


Ovviamente ogni singola cosa non sarà lasciata al caso e verrà spiegato tutto nei minimi dettagli, con template pronti per velocizzare il processo operativo.

Parlando nel concreto, la disponibilità sarà via via maggiore, ovviamente in funzione dei clienti. Più si cresce, più si lavora. Prevedo comunque all’inizio un lavoro di 2-3 ore al giorno, ma nel giro di un mese si potrebbe già dover gestire in autonomia 5-10 progetti.


Per la questione economica, tutto gira intorno ai risultati che si portano ma, per darti delle stime, per un singolo progetto potresti guadagnare in media dai 200€ ai 500€.

Non voglio far passare che si possa guadagnare molto con poco, perché dietro c’è sicuramente del lavoro da fare e dobbiamo farlo dannatamente bene.

Ma come vedi è molto meritocratico: se si semina bene, si raccoglie bene.


Se ti interessa, rispondi a questa proposal, facendo questa piccola task:

1. Cerca un talento: dimmi un nome di un’azienda che potrebbe essere interessante. 
2. Fai un video loom in cui mi dici cosa faresti per aiutarla a quantomeno triplicare il fatturato.

Non è necessario che tu mi dia la risposta esatta, mi piacerebbe solo vedere come ragioni.

Inoltre, inserisci nella prima frase la parola: talent.

Spero di vederti presto

"Digital Marketing, Including Google Ads and CRO",Marketing,"SkillBurst Interactive is seeking an exceptional Digital Marketing expert for an initial 3-month project to make a BIG impact.  The Digital Marketing expert will work with us to plan, research, create, implement, monitor, and maintain a successful digital marketing campaign.  The goal of the campaign is to increase conversion volume and quality, while ultimately driving sales. 

This project will include milestones, established in coordination with you, and may be expanded for longer-term support.  We envision this initial 3-month engagement to market one specific offering and to include:

•	New campaign and ad group creation and launch, leveraging single keyword ad groups and other approaches that you recommend in order to optimize performance and conversions
•	Keyword research, management, bid optimization, and ongoing analysis and refinement
•	Target audience and geographic set-up, ongoing analysis, and improvements
•	Competitor analysis and recommendations learned through analysis
•	Ongoing monitoring, analysis, and maintenance to optimize campaign performance while working to reduce cost per acquisition  
•	Tracking conversions and continually working to improve campaign performance
•	Conversion rate optimization, including landing page recommendations
Additionally, we’d like you to:
•	Recommend new campaigns for future marketing efforts
•	Recommend budgets, allocations, and other opportunities for consideration

The goal of this initiative is to establish and scale a robust digital marketing campaign focused on one specific offering and timeline (for now) that pays for itself (and more) through sales generation.  Quantitative and qualitative performance goals and measures should be established during the planning stage, tracked, and routinely analyzed and reported against to ensure we have a clear understanding of performance and results.

At this time, we are looking for someone to serve as our digital marketing advisor and implementation expert.  We are looking for a candidate that is happy and willing to partner and work closely with our small team to explain and educate throughout the process (we are not marketing experts).  This includes communicating in easy-to-understand terms and ensuring campaign plans, research findings, approaches, performance results, evolving ideas and tactics, and anything else of value and importance is shared proactively along the way. In support of this initiative, we will provide ad copy and content needed, but will look to you for feedback and recommendations to support optimal ad performance.

- Business size: small and medium size (about 5-100 employees)

Then, find the contact info for the business. Ideally, use LinkedIn to find the Chief Marketing Officer or other key decision maker's email and/or Linkedin Profile. However, the most important part is the YouTube piece. If you can't do linkedin, I still might be able to work with you.

We have pages owned by multiple people, and certain pages with limited access, and we need to get our FB advertising account set up correctly as well. 

On top of that mess, we need help in getting our google analytics set up so we can accurately track our customers.

GA4:

Google Ads:
Also need some help reviewing my google ad account setup. Posting in this ad because maybe that's something you do too or you do only - either is fine.

Spotify Music Promotion,Marketing,"Hello everyone 👋

Around 7 months ago, I started releasing my own music on all the streaming-platforms.
So far I released 8 tracks (house, pop, dance) and got 500K streams mainly on Spotify.
The tracks have been added to around 2K playlists (with multiple listeners). The next 3 tracks will be released one by one within the next 3–4 months.
But: So far, I got less than 100 followers on Spotify. I also came up with my own playlist and tried to promote it, but I got only 25 followers for the playlist.

My Spotify: https://spotify.link/zCtNSQyepyb

So my overall goal is to release one song every six weeks and start to promote them on social media. I tried several things on my own, but I'm not an expert in doing performance marketing on social media.

I'm looking for an experienced partner in promoting artists and playlists to constantly grow my audience.

Looking forward to getting in contact with you. 🚀

Growth-Hack Expert Needed to Boost Traffic to New Website - Games / Education Industry,Marketing,"I'm looking for someone who can help our new website get a jumpstart with organic search and traffic.

We need help acquiring backlinks, social mentions, or ANYTHING that will generate useful traffic and attention. Creative and growth-hack ideas welcome!

Our website is: funfactco.com
It is in the education / game / retail space. The target audience would be people who like tabletop games and trivia games, homeschool parents, educators and anyone who likes clickbait 'fun fact' lists.

We are launching our first game on Kickstarter and the campaign is currently live. However, our goal for this project is to get traffic to the main website in hopes they will click-through to Kickstarter (for now).

This project will be a flat-rate to start. Since the company is so new, we have some budget limits. However, if the Kickstarter campaign is successful, I envision ongoing work together!

Please share a list of what you could achieve within the budget.

Just some ideas of what that could include:
- Backlinks on non-spammy sites
- Reddit post on our behalf
- Guest posts on other blogs (we can provide an article about the brand and game)
- Mentions in Facebook groups
- Mentions in email blasts
- Mentions on other social channels

We're looking to start immediately.
We can share a Press Kit about the brand / project, video links AND affiliate links (10% commissions for Kickstarter pledges).",Content SEO,,Education,Media & Entertainment,Retail & Consumer Goods,SEO Backlinking,Off-Page SEO,Organic Traffic Growth,Google Analytics,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,6.398594935,12,0,300,,18,Brand Development,Marketing,Other
We need an open source mailchimp-like service for a CBD oil company or equivalent solution,Marketing,"My company, New South Botanicals has been kicked off mailchimp after it got acquired by Intuit because we sell CBD oil. I’ve since tried two other services, MailerLite and Moosend, but have been kicked off both of them via some kind of automated system, despite them being on list (some blog post) of email marketing platforms that allow CBD oil.

I’ve recently received some CBD related spam (in this case, it was unsolicited) from another company that uses something called KMail. Maybe that’s a solution. I don’t know, if there is a company that is cool with CBD oil marketing we could just use that but I haven’t found a solution yet.

PLEASE DO NOT APPLY IF you don’t match with ALL the requirements and traits. We will check everything in depth and will automatically skip you even if  you don’t match in 1.




Working hours and Time availability:

We require an availability of 7 days per week, from around 4/5 hours per day, up to 7/8 hours per day on busier days. This will not be forever, but for sure for the first months, while you are still the only media buyer.
On the other hand, while working days are not very flexible, working hours are.

Facebook ads management: Usually lasts around 2-4 hours depending on the day. And must be done between 00 AM and 10 AM(Italian timezone). But there are a few(usually small) tasks regarding facebook ads management that can only be done within 00 AM and 03 AM(Italian time zone). So there might be the need to start working on them during this time on some days, for this reason we specifically wrote ”Open to wake up early in the morning(around 6 AM PH Time Zone) when needed. But in general being very flexible with time availability” in the requirements.

Facebook ads launch, tiktok ads management, google ads management+other related tasks: Usually last around 2-5 hours depending on the day. And can be done from 03 AM to 6PM(Italian time zone), this is the very flexible part.


OFF DAYS:
We do require a 7/7 availability, but every 2-3 weeks we offer the possibility to take 1-2 days off, or almost completely off. This part will be discussed in the first days after the hire.



The Company:


We are a fully remote company based in Italy counting almost 15 employees.
Half of our team lives in Italy, the other half in the Philippines.
Our warehouse is in Italy and completely managed by a logistic center, we do not drop ship, we run an inventory based model.
The majority of our orders are not paid online but on delivery(currently 94% of orders are COD), this is our main focus and edge over competition.

Our goal is to become the largest COD e-commerce in the world. And to make the purchase of any product accessible to everyone, with any payment method, especially with cash on delivery. All this while providing a wide catalog of products, excellent customer service and fast shippings.



The Job(In the short term):

Before starting with the explanation regarding the job, we want to clarify that:
-You must respect all the traits and mentioned requirements.
-The first weeks, maybe even the first month or 2, will be spent in learning everything regarding this job. We will teach you all you need to know, from A to Z. 

The job will consist in managing all our Facebook ads, Tiktok ads, google ads(maybe even new platforms as they pop up) and Everything related to the products that will be advertised, such as when to launch them, where to launch them, and how to price them for an optimal profit margin.

In addition, you will also be in charge of coordinating your “ads creative” needs(for new products, for non performing products, for new launches etc…) with our graphic designers.


The Job(In the long term):

The job in the long term, as the company grows and requires more hours to be spent media buying, once we will max out your working hours, we will hire someone to help you and you will then be in charge of doing your part+managing this team.

As we grow even more, once the team starts to become bigger and bigger, if you keep up with our growth, and manage to grow yourself as well(as a person), you might become our CMO.


Salary:

The Salary, considering an estimate of 200 hours a month(of work), will be around 1200 USD(6USD/H).
Please note that this is the starting salary, obviously as we grow and you take on more and more responsibilities, and manage more team members, the salary will increase.
As a CMO the salary might be even X2-3 times higher

Real Estate Agent Needs Marketing Expert,Marketing,"I am in my 4th year of real estate and have had great success with marketing by word of mouth but am looking to push harder with digital marketing. I am competent at basic marketing and have done lots of social marketing before but nothing structured and I am not an expert; that's what I want. 

Looking to create a solid foundation to reboot my online marketing presence and push it in the right direction while learning the right techniques and tools along the way. I have setup tracking Pixels and started Google Analytics but don't feel I'm utilizing things properly or leveraging as very large database effectively. I want to expand my reach, increase my website traffic and qualified online lead generation. I expect to do this through more content posts (which can be part of this job but don't have to be), more online events and live or video content.

I need help building the machine and making a plan to use it. If it goes well, I may need help running it as well.

Thank you for your time.

I currently have an agency that is providing this service  but I am dissatisfied with the results after 8 months, my expectations are reasonable for ROAS.

Instagram Growth & Management Expert,Marketing,"I'm looking for an amazing Instagram Expert to build my IG profile from the ground up with the ultimate goal of growing my followers and creating sales leads. 

In my business I help established business owners leverage their success by creating digital programs and automated sales systems that scale their brand online. 

I'm a Digital Marketing Strategist and Online Business Mentor but use primarily LinkedIn and Facebook, and now I want to start leveraging Instagram.

I am currently starting to post regularly, but with IG being so in-depth I really don't know where to start when it comes to the intricacies of creating good content that engages on there. What works on LinkedIn doesn't seem to work as well on IG. 

I want to work with someone to create a full strategy, with about section, a nice looking grid and ustilising reels and stories for lead gen. I would like to understand exactly what can be taken off my hands, and how much I need to get involved eg - how much content do I have to provide for stories and reels etc. 

Ideally I want a daily posting schedule, but it will depend on the package cost I guess as I am still in start up stage. 

I think working with someone for a one-month trial would be good, and then if all goes well I see this as a long term monthly partnership.

Some of the qualities I deem as important when working with someone:
- Attention to detail is really important to me, especially when it comes to spelling and instructions etc.
- Pride in your work and a diligence to get things right
- Clear and easy communication
- Positive, solutions focused attitude
- Honesty and integrity

I would love to see examples of your work, IG accounts you currently manage, examples of images, videos and written content etc.

Thanks

Whether you're writing blog posts, articles, or other forms of digital content, the role of a content writer is both challenging and rewarding.

Challenges of a Content Writer

One of the biggest challenges of being a content writer is meeting deadlines and producing high-quality work on a consistent basis. It can be tough to balance multiple projects and deliver work that meets the expectations of clients or editors. Additionally, writers often have to deal with writer's block, and finding the right words to express their ideas can sometimes be a challenge.

Whether you're providing information, educating your audience, or entertaining them, your writing has the power to make a difference in people's lives.

Another reward is the flexibility and autonomy that comes with working as a content writer. You have the ability to choose your own hours and work from anywhere, making it a great career option for those who value independence and freedom.

Do You Have 3 Hours Per Week in Your SEO Schedule? Fill it With Me. ,Marketing,"It can get exhausting to review and message dozens of people. When at the end the freelancers essentially want a paycheck every week without any assurance that the outcome the client is seeking can be met.

If you have minimum number of hours per week, this job is NOT for you. Please do not reply. 

I know what works to rank local websites and low search volume phrases ...and it is not 40 hours a month. I have he proof of dozens of projects. 

If you have time and want to deploy your tactics and strategy to one or even several sites, and you have 2 or more examples of ranking number 1 and or number 2 for keywords that have over 100 per month search volume, there's a good chance we can work together on one or more projects.

Social Media Manager For Personal Instagram,Marketing,"Hey there,

Looking for a social media expert that specializes in personal branding on Instagram. Ideally, someone that has a decent IG following themself.

I run an online business that leaves me very time-poor, but I would like to invest my spare time into building up my personal brand as I travel and work around the world. 

A few examples of the role would be:

1. Editing and retouching photos

2. Coming up with captions for posts

3. Do research for shoot locations and ideas

4. Schedule posts and plan the grid

5. Overall general consulting

Being a 29 y/o single male, the outcome I am going for is to build a profile that will allow me to reach out, an network with high-value entrepreneurs, and also be pleasing to high-value females for dating (not too entrepreneurial). 

So ideally someone that is either a high-value/high social-status individual in their own right or someone that knows the target demographic well. (Sorry if that sounds cringe don't know how else to put it 😅 haha). The goal isn't to necessarily grow a following but to put out very on-brand, high-value content. The goal IG is to be like this https://www.instagram.com/mikethurston/ (Just wearing a shirt more)

MUST have a high level of written and verbal English

To show you are serious can you please answer the following questions to the best of your ability

1. Give a brief storyline of your background in social media management/personal branding?

2. A brief overview of your own success with personal branding on Instagram? 

3. What is your motivation in life and/or your career?

Pinterest Specialist to Write Pin Descriptions and Create Pins in Canva,Marketing,"I’m looking for someone to help me write pin descriptions and create Pinterest images each week.

Here is a summary of what the role entails:

-Each week, I will provide you with a list of 8 new blog post titles

-You will write a pin description for each blog post, ensuring relevant and trending keywords from Pinterest have been incorporated

-You will also create 5 pins x 8 blog posts per week, for a total of 40 pins 

-Pins will be created in Canva using my business account

-I am not looking to change anything regarding the look/feel of the pins - you would be using the existing template and creating pins from there

-I will provide a list of headers for all of the pins as well as some creative direction so you know what photos to choose when creating the pins

-I will need the pins to be editable in Canva as I often make changes depending on the content of the blog post, personal preference for blog branding, etc. The idea is for you to do all of the upfront work so I can just finesse it before each blog post is published. You must be comfortable with me making changes

Facebook profeshonal page create,Marketing,"In mid-April 2023, Instant Articles will no longer be available. Until then, you still have access to insights and monetisation related to your Instant Articles. Since 14 October 2022, only existing partners have access to Instant Articles.
An Instant Article is an HTML document that loads very quickly in Facebook, giving publishers the ability to tell rich stories in a branded and customisable article format that renders fast on mobile.

Instant Articles provides a faster, Facebook-native way of distributing the content that publishers already produce for their own websites. Every article published as an Instant Article must be published on a news publisher's website as well.

When posting Instant Articles to Facebook, publishers and readers link to articles just as they always have. Each Instant Article is associated with a URL link, so when a link is shared in Feed, readers on Facebook see the Instant Article version if it's available.

Instant Articles work for any type of article, from daily coverage to long-form, in-depth features. Instant Articles are available for readers with iPhones and Android devices running the following software versions or above:

iPhone Facebook for iPhone version 30.0 and iOS 7.0
Android Facebook for Android version 57 and Android Jelly Bean
An Instant Article is an HTML document optimised for fast mobile performance, rich storytelling capabilities, branded design and customised visual display. Instant Articles use a standardised markup language (similar to XML) to apply styles and interactive functionality to a story.

This markup can be applied automatically, to enable automated publication of an entire content feed at scale. Alternatively, it can be applied manually to create bespoke stories that take full advantage of Instant Article capabilities and rich-media elements.

Instant Articles will not be automatically posted. Publishers should share articles on their Pages just as they always have.

Instant Articles are ranked in Feed by the same criteria that we use to rank standard articles on the mobile web. Feed ranks stories based on a number of factors, including the amount that people interact with them and how much time people spend reading them.

To set up Instant Articles, use our quick-start guide.",Facebook,,,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,8,0,,32.5,3,Content Marketing,API Development,Other

Looking for help setting up Google Ads,Marketing,"I currently have a new Youtube channel for a business. We are advertising on Youtube with video and overlay ads in order to generate leads for our upcoming crowdfunding campaign, ideally doing it in a way for the biggest bang for the buck.
That being said, I’m slowly discovering some of these challenges.
•	Structuring audience groups properly (to find best targeting combinations)
•	Structuring my ad creatives to figure out the winners properly
•	Having a proper bidding strategy so that I’m not breaking the bank to determine what works well yet enough to have a proper sample size without exhausting the budget almost immediately. 
I currently don’t have the budget to hire someone to run the campaign entirely. That being said, I’m posting the ad here in the hopes of getting some assistance in setting things up properly. I can monitor and tweak things myself, but there could be an opportunity to have regular work sessions/calls in order to better resolve problems.

Outsource Call Center Search - projects area of responsibility: Europe,Marketing,"JOB OFFER - Outsource Call Center Search - projects area of responsibility: Italy

Help us find a call Center 

We are searching for call centers all around the world for a long term collaboration. Requirements are simple - they should be able to call to Italy and should not have like a strong foreign accent. So best case are call centers who offer the languages spoken in the mentioned countries. Second requirement is we offer just a commission based model only. Further informations in the project briefing below. 

A short summary what the collaboration for the Call Centers would be about:

It's about the truck cartel (all big truck companies) & diesel emissions scandal - The Call centers specific task is about helping/informing companies in Europe (including all Balkan countries + Turkey + UK) that they get compensation for a period of 20 years during which they bought/rented/leased trucks and cars. In that period the prices have been manipulated form the truck cartel.

The amount in dispute is now around 1.8 billion Euros, of which the call centers could receive a commission by simple informing our leads about their compensation. The great part is it is no selling, it is just informing the company. The companies themselves have zero costs and zero risks. 

We are working with 3 major companies - law firm in Munich, process pre-financier (private equity investment company from the US) and the consumer protection, on whose behalf we will act.

We already prepared a full back office with tracking, CRM and all leads, PDFs, training videos, scripts and onboarding for the call centers. Furthermore, in order to get all data, details and insights including documents of the legal decisions, an NDA has to be signed of the Call centers CEO or Director during the onboarding process. Contracts etc. will also be prepared for the Call centers CEO or Director and given to them during the process. The representative will be the only person who gets onboarded and he will manage all leads and allocate them to the call centers agents. 

You can give the call centers a quick example of how their work will look like. They will call one of our leads and just inform them of the compensation they are entitled to receive for all trucks and cars purchased/leased/rented between 1998 - 2018. For example, if the company purchased 1,000 trucks and 100 cars, with just this one lead they would receive 10 euros/truck = 10,000 euros plus 10euros/car = 1.000 euros. In average they gonna ‚close‘ 60 trucks per hour. So they can calculate their approximate commissions themselves.

They will get tens of thousands of high quality leads from us (in total we have 17 million leads that can be allocated). We think this would be very very lucrative for anyone, so that’s why we offer a commission based model only (if they are not working on commission only, please let us know right away - in that case we cannot work with them for now). Commissions are paid out within 2-4 weeks and runs automatically through their own back office. 

If a commission based model holds them back from working with us - you can offer them something else. Let's say we work with one of their agents for a week or two as a free trial phase. They can test everything, they get some of our highly qualified leads and see if it works for their company. If the trial weeks went well, they probably already made a few thousand euros. After this trial period, they can decide whether or not we want to continue with a pure commission-based model. So they can't really lose anything and they have minimal risk, except some time it takes for just one of their agents. 

If you are interested and want to know more details, please contact me as soon as possible.

I would be happy to welcome some call centers on board soon.

Facebook Ads Agency With Rep,Marketing,"I'm an owner of a drug rehab facility and also I've been in charge of the facebook ads since inception. I'm currently trying to double the amount of admissions we are trying to bring I have the sales staff ready to handle the lead growth. The issue I'm running into is I feel my campaigns are hitting a wall maybe the creatives or ad is fatigued or my structure isn't ideal basically at the $30-$40k ad spend mark it's running fine and has been with the same ads for 2 years. I tried to increase the budget for more leads all that happened was my cost per lead increased. I ended up spending $70,000 and getting the same amount of leads.

Right now I'm generating 500 leads per week with avg cost per lead of $20.

I need to generate 1000 leads per week with the same CPA or lower.

Additionally the most important and requirement I have is you must be an agency that has a facebook rep. 

These ad accounts I have are my bread and butter and so far nothing has been disabled. I need the extra level of protection if someone handles my account. Please only apply if you have a rep.

Seeking Ecommerce Expert for Growing Safety Startup!,Marketing,"Hello,

I hope all is well. My name is Anthony; in August 2020, I founded SwypeSure (www.swypesure.com), an e-commerce & media company at the intersection of safety, personal health, and wellness. We curate a range of easy-to-use products and share safety tips for our customers to promote a safe and healthy lifestyle. We also have a Shopify store through which people can purchase various types of safety items. Since the launch of SwypeSure, we have gained over 77k followers on Instagram and 86k followers on TikTok, creating a community of safety advocates.

As noted, we have a Shopify store, which was recently created. Despite our following on IG and TikTok, our sales have been rather sluggish so far. Shopify's decision to remove us from Shopify payments because we sell ""weapons"" did not help matters either. After much effort, I was able to find a new payment processor and we are officially back in business! 

With that said, I am looking for someone who understands the Ecommerce space inside and out and can help make SwypeSure an Ecommerce success story. I should note that we dropship products to customers; I do not house any products myself. I am looking for someone who has a proven track record of success in Ecommerce and has generated modest to significant revenue for their store/ brand. When it comes to this job, you will be given as much creative freedom as you need to help us grow. As long as you understand the nuances of Ecommerce and believe in what SwypeSure represents, I am confident that we will work well together!

I am ultimately trying to make the world a safer place and educate people as to the importance and value of safety, particularly for women. SwypeSure has the potential to become the Amazon of safety products; I truly believe this.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read my post. You have no idea how much it means to me! I hope you will be open to helping me in any way you can.

Kindest regards,

Anthony

Ideally, we can work together to come up with a concept for ""re-inventing Caller ID"" so perhaps we start with the original Apple iPhone and from there, paint the vision of how its all changing.  I can share screenshots, etc.

Also, ideally you've got time this weekend to work on them, so we can finish by Sunday night.

You can learn more about LinkedIn carousel ads here:  https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/success/ads-guide/carousel-ads

Thank you.

Designer need for postcard direct mailing for home service company,Marketing,"Hi all,

I run an electrical business that focuses on the residential market (homeowners).  We currently run three different post card mailers as part of our overall marketing plan.

We use vistaprint to mail and design these postcard (we design them ourselves).

I'm hoping to find someone to help take our designs to the next level.  I'm definitely open to some outside the box ideas.

I would like to find someone with experience / success making postcard mailers. 

The three mailers we have going right now are as follows -
- Existing customers, mailed once per quarter
- Neighborhood mailers - we mail to the same neighborhoods we are working in, while the truck / vans are there.  This happens once per month. 
- Knob and tube wiring mailers - we own a list of single family homes built pre 1935 and mail 3000 mailers per month to these homes.  These mailers are geared towards knob and tube wiring replacement (first kind of wire used in homes).

I look forward to chatting with you all about this project! We'd want to alter these 3 designs right off the bat. IF things go well there could be some recurring jobs as we update designs and experiment with more mailers down the road.

Thank you for reading!
Jesse Kuhlman.

B2B Sales Strategist needed for consulting offer,Marketing,"Hello, my name is Devin McPaul.

I'm spinning up a new offer that helps big SaaS companies build in-house media companies.

Think segmented influencer marketing, but they own the influencers.

Already have a killer case study with ClickUp ($4B company).

And I have generated over 1,000,000,000 organic content views over the last few years as an agency owner.

Charging $10k/mo for my base retainer, and clients must have an additional $30-100k/mo available for talent + tool + promo expenses.

Looking to work with more badass B2C SaaS companies.

I'm at a complete loss regarding sales.

So I'd like someone to either do the selling for me, or help me find a top-tier commission-based sales partner.

Mainly looking to work with someone who already has experience selling to big tech companies.

In your application, please share a rough idea as to how we might be able to break into this market, as well as proof of your competence.

What I need now is a plan and the execution to start getting some marketing campaigns going to get some readers reading! I am not as concerned with profiting as I am with getting readers, and getting marketing campaigns and efforts in place to start tracking results and impact.

I need someone who can not only coach and help plan, but also take over execution and implementation. I need more than advice, I need active help and someone to drive things until we start seeing some readers purchasing, downloading, etc.

Social Media Support - Carousel Post data entry/Creator in Canva + Larger Canva Project,Marketing,"I am a Women's Empowerment Coach looking to align with a Heart-centered, Creative, Tech-smart Human, who wants to play a pivotal role in helping me spread love and share my voice through my social media and support my current students.  

Once you've read this ad, if you feel this would be in alignment with you, I'd love to hear from you.  You can let me know a bit about yourself, your experience, and why it feels like a good fit.  :)   

*The job is listed in USD for payment.  I am in Canada and have converted the rate accordingly from 15$CAD per hour. 

Seeking a virtual assistant for two specific Canva projects in my business. 

1.  ONGOING weekly Support - CAROUSEL POSTS 
What I need:  3 completed Carousel Posts in Canva, ready for me to download and use the coming week by Sunday evening EST (Ottawa, Canada time).  
Your role:  
-DATA ENTRY of the written content I provided from google document entered into pre-prepared templates. 
- very small refinements/tweaks to ensure the post is visually pleasing.
- Small design elements - from time to time add a graphic/chart/visual aid if the post calls for it.  This could mean finding the perfect one in Canva or taking my description/hand drawing of what and making it happen.

My expectation is that with your level of expertise, working within your zone of genius while having fun doing this, it will take max 1 HOUR per week to make the 3 posts.   

2.  ONE TIME PROJECT - PROGRAM WORKBOOK Design, Data Entry, and Creation.

This project involves working with bits and pieces of worksheets and content I have designed and used with clients over the years and also a ton of written content that I have in google documents.   I'll provide creative direction, a specific outline, and order to put it all in and you will amalgamate and pull it all together in one big client WorkBook called the Foundations Playbook.  

- You'll see that a design style is already a bit established with some of the parts but you'll also be taking creative inspiration from the carousel templates design style.  
- You'll mostly be doing data entry, and cut/copy/paste here but there will definitely be a fun design element.  

- My budget for this project is 12 hours maximum.  

ABOUT YOU: 

- You love working with Canva and are experienced doing it. (you've got great references) 
- Being a VA is totally within your zone of genius.  
- You are both creative and 'techie' so this work feels easy, aligned, and fun.  Because of this, you work FAST.  
- You have an entrepreneurial spirit, and that's why supporting another entrepreneur feels really awesome! 
- You are into personal development in a big way.  You are someone who does ""the work"" so to speak.   
- You understand that editing and amalgamating the workbook for a coaching program means that you will see the teachings my students pay thousands of dollars for.  That perk is SO not lost on you! 
-That being said, you are trustworthy.  You understand that you will be seeing proprietary information and intellectual property and would never violate the terms of your agreement with me. 
-You understand what radical self-responsibility means and you strive for this.  
- You are heart-centered, caring, and empathetic.  
- You are excited about the long-term relationship this could be if it's the right fit.  

ABOUT ME: 

- I am a Women's empowerment Coach, Somatic Practitioner, Trauma Integration Practitioner, and Spiritual Mentor for Determined Women. 
- I am deeply heart-centered and Empathetic.
- I value high-quality design and it's one of my greatest passions.  I am aesthetically very sensitive. 
- I am on a mission to end the epidemic of ""Not Good Enough"" in this lifetime and I am deeply committed to this as a coach and leader.  
- I am not a techie person so you will probably receive photos of hand-drawn graphics that I need to be made from time to time.  Also, I may not know the terms for things and I'll just give directions the best I can.  I'm that person. 
- I am a 6/2 Sacral Generator. Leo Sun, Leo Rising, Taurus Moon.

Need a PR Person Familiar with Ryan Holidays Strategies,Marketing,"Not looking for traditional media pitching strategies. Looking for someone that has read the book Trust Me I'm Lying by Ryan Holiday and can put the strategies to work.

How best to work with me:
1. Do what you say you're going to do when you say you're going to do it. Don't make promises you can't keep. Don't make excuses or create reasons why you can't get the work done (I've heard it all already... there's only so many times you can hear that a freelancer's power went out or they had a death in the family or there was a storm). Keep your deadlines no matter what. 
2. Don't fall off of the face of earth... stay in communication.
3. Use the tracker. Don't come up with lame reasons why you can't use the tracker (""It crashed"" or ""I forgot to use it"" or “it doesn’t work on this device.”). For clarification, the tracker is the part that takes screenshots of your work and keeps track of your time for you. It IS NOT you adding manual time. Manual time won’t be approved.
4. Don't try to change the parameters of the job to make things easier on yourself. Accommodate what I need done.
5. The job is hourly. Don't try to negotiate a flat rate. On hourly tasks, please don’t ask me to release payment. Payment will automatically be released according to the platform’s schedule.
6. You must speak English well so that we can communicate properly.
7. Don't ask what my budget is. I'm usually talking with several freelancers to find the best price. So give me your best price, otherwise you will lose out on the job. I don’t like negotiating and if you’re willing to negotiate, that means that you didn’t give me your best price initially and you didn’t follow instructions.
8. I need this done ASAP. Please don’t accept the job and then tell me that you can’t start working on it now. Don’t give me a short deadline to get the job and then ask me for an extension later.
9. Please don’t ask me to close the project or ask me for feedback. There is no deadline to a project and keeping a project doesn’t hurt your account (please check with the platform to verify). I like to keep projects open so that I continue to use you when I need you.
10. When I ask you what the quickest time frame you can complete the job is… tell me. Don’t ask for my timeline. I’m always trying to find the person that can do it the fastest. Don’t turn my questions around on me. Just answer the questions.
11. If you’re in a different time zone than me, please make efforts to accommodate my time zone.
12. I hate chasing people so give me updates at least once a day and more frequent updates on urgent tasks.
13. Please don’t ask me to “jump on a call” (or zoom). This is my least favorite method of communication. Whatsapp is my preferred method of communication so that’s what we will use.
14. Please don’t ask for user names or passwords to my accounts unless you’ve accepted the job. This is for my security.
15. Don’t repeatedly message me “are you there?” Just tell me what you need and I will reply when I can. And don’t continually message me about the same thing if I haven’t responded.
16. I don’t want your team of people working on this. No agencies. I only want the owner of the profile working on this and I need direct access to them.
I will issue negative feedback for violating any of these items.




How to Apply:
Don’t send a copy of your resume or copy and paste your generic cover letter that you’ve sent to dozens of other employers (trust me, we’ll know). Instead, send us a personalized message referencing specific details in our posting (not just the title of the job) and tell us why you would be the best fit for the position (and what specific experience you have). In your reply, please also tell me how many hours a week you have available for work. Also, in your reply, please confirm that you agree to the 16 points above.",Media Pitch,,Press Release,,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,10.59665973,12,3.135494216,,20,3,Branding & Marketing,CRM and Marketing Tools,Other

Need a marketing rock star ,Marketing,"Most resources go into app development but it's an app that I think a marketing rock star could sink thier teeth into it. 

Stych allows the user to create a single video file of thier life through streaming technology. They just tap record and stop as moments come up and we generate a single streaming file back to the device with easy navigation to the individual clips. No buffering or waiting for files to load. You watch it like you watch Netflix. 

It's super slick and has great features. Like sharing life files. So parents can start a file for thier baby and share the life file later. 

What we need is awareness that this exists and it will go. . 

Let me know what your strategy for igniting would be and what work you have done igniting things in the past.  

Great opportunity and compensation we can sort out.

TikTok Ads specialist (grey market),Marketing,"Hey there,

we have an TikTok ad video which we would like to advertise. Sadly, the TikTok Support told us that our video ad ""features users completing a service (making surveys) for earning money.""

This is true. We are an opinion research institute, which creates surveys for different brands. The people who complete those surveys will get rewarded in points. Those points then can be converted to a direct payout to their bank account or an Amazon voucher.

Because we do not have an TikTok ads account anymore we either need to promote the ad via an agency account or we can try to create a new account.

We are eagerly awaiting your application and hope to find a solution. Please include in your application a way we can solve this problem and why do you think you can solve it. Only people who provide solutions will be considered!

Marketing Pro to develop copy & layout for AI/Computer Vision Device and SaaS services,Marketing,"Our product is a fairly niche application with a lot of competition.  Often our clients are won through relationships and word of mouth rather than features and price, as these are both commoditized in the industry and often products are “very similar.”

We have a unique opportunity to direct-market to a huge client base of a well-known company in our industry, but one that does not offer the same products and services that we do.  Our product is complimentary to theirs, and they will distribute our marketing materials directly to their clients.

What we need – A skilled marketing pro that can spend time talking with us about our product, services, and specifically how they apply to this partner and their client base.  We’ll want you to gain a deep understanding about how our product is different, and how this can really help the potential customer base we will market to.  Interviews with some current clients for testimonials is also an option.

Once you understand the product, and how much it can help the potential customers, you’ll develop very targeted copy that will ring all the bells.  When they read it their only reaction will be, “I want this!”  Some basic layout options or direction will be very helpful that we can hand off to our graphic designer. 

This will be a one or two-pager, not really a brochure.  Something that the customer can open in their email, open the attachment, and get captivated by the possibilities we can offer them.

Our industry is public safety, law enforcement, covert, defense, and high-tech.  Examples of your previous work, or anything similar is highly encouraged with your proposal.  Ready to get started with the right person immediately.

Mailgun Expert for Integration and Set Up Consultation,Marketing,"Hi! We’re FirstEditing and we’re looking for a Mailgum expert who can, as a first step, analyze our current email system and set up and provide advice on how we could migrate our newsletters and email to Mailgun.

We currently use our own email system which is a MySQL CRM with PHP, that we use to build all our newsletters and transactional emails. Although the templates themselves are being created in BeeFree and then we copy-paste the HTML into the system. We currently use Mailgun only for the delivery of emails. We have come to realize it’s not the most comfortable or user-friendly alternative for us.

- We would like to consider building our newsletter templates directly in Mailgun. 
- Being able to easily select the delivery list for the newsletters in Mailgun.
- Maybe even move the transactional emails and their automation to Mailgun.

But we need an expert since we’re not clear on how we could integrate Mailgun with the current system, or whether we need to migrate the emails lists to Mailgun, or whether we can connect through an API.

Let us a bit about your experience and how you could help us with this.

Seraching proper influencers - Sweden,Marketing,"Hi! We are a small company exclusively distributing a product called Thermomix in Sweden. Thermomix is a kitchen robot that also cooks! It’s amazing! :) Check it up at thermomix.se

Thermomix is brutally popular in countries like France, Germany, Spain or Italy. But not so much in Sweden. So we believe there is a huge business opportunity.

We started the business 4 years ago and we’re doing fairly well, addressing many marketing channels, although the influencers part has never been properly covered.

We are steadily growing, but mainly among expat communities, where Thermomix is brutally popular. We think well chosen Influencers might help us grow among Swedes in a way we cn afford.

To be frank, when we’ve tried with influencers it’s never worked: lack of chemistry with them, not choosing the right ones for our target groups, not knowing what to ask in return them to donfor js, bad follow up of the deliveries, bad retribution negotiation,… A mess.

But we think influencers is a key missing piece in our strategy.
We’re ready to investigate this field, but we need to start small testing if there is return in the investment. But starting small: we’re a profitable business, but a small one with limited financial resources. Obviously.

We need a Swedish expert to assess us and to execute this strategy. We’re ready to pay a fee  for you + the influencer costs. But we’re ready to discuss the best way to pay for your services. We’re open to ideas.

Can you help us building one understanding our financial constraints?

Market research expert to conduct Rebrand research study,Marketing,"We are a DTC brand that is about to rebrand as we graduate. 

Our brand naturalpatch.com has been around 3 years and here is why we are rebranding.

1. Our business equity and valuation is not just revenue, but will be brand. Need to be defensible. 
2. It's still immature, packaging and website perform, but are not consistent, don't tell a cohesive story, people don't know what we stand for
3. Need to level up, bold, especially for retail. 
4. We have a collection of products (sleepypatch, allergypatch, buzzpatch) but we're known for BuzzPatch. That's a product brand. Like Unilver having Dove, Lynx, Ben & Jerry's, Rexona. We don't want to invest in building a house of brands. We want a brand, with multiple product lines. All tied together.

1. We hired a globally renowned brand strategist (ex Global Director of Brand for Uber) to help us figure out what the brand could be (Strategy). We interviewed brand agencies, about 15 of them, but decided to split out the work - strategy and design/voice identity. Whole lot of reasons we did this, notably, wanted best strategist for the job, wanted best creative for the job. Hard to find a shop with both.

He worked for 4 months interviewing us founders, customers, considering the market, the gap, where we can be bold and stand out - to distiI our values, mission, territories, voice, wants, emotions, etc etc. 

Fundamentally we distilled that we ""playfully solve life's problems"" and that we are solving parent anxiety, not the actual issue. Ie, we're not solving sleep for kids. We're solving parents worried about not getting ""me time"" at night. We're not worried about mosquitoes, we're solving parents anxiety in dealing with grumpy kids itching all over. And so on.

We need to lean into that, celebrate parents for their incredible juggling act, and show them we're here, we get them, we are one of them, and we want to take one thing off their plate. Naturally, safely, simply.

The brief was to make something bold, a bit uncomfortable (like a song you don't love initially but becomes a legend vs a song you love instantly and forget in 5 minutes). Something that could own the category, be defensible, un-copyable, be lovable for kids, lovable for parents.

2. Find and brief a design shop (he interviewed 9 design houses, and 7 tone of voice/verbal houses) based on the experience of DTC, retail, parent/kid related brand.

They needed to get what we were trying to achieve.

We have the output of the rebrand which we love, but before we sign off, we want to conduct some research. 

We don’t know what research we need, both to identify things people love about our current brand, and then to get feelings around our new brand.

We need someone with brand research expertise to:
1. Guide us on what research to do 
2. Help us recruit (we have 500k customers in different geographies with different NPS ranges we can recruit)
3. Design the research surveys
4.

I own a start-up health and wellness brand in the IV Drip Space. We are based in Sydney and offer convenient, mobile IV Drips and booster shots for the health & wellness conscious, the anti-ager and those wanting to boost their performance or fight a hangover.

We are currently pre-launch with our website and have our visual guide in development due soon.

I require a social media marketer to assist with the development of a social media strategy, to grow our presence, develop ads and create content.

The successful candidate will:
- Have excellent design skills
- Have excellent design taste
- Have a demonstrated history of growing social media accounts and growing reach and engagement organically
- Be a skilled advertiser and know how to develop ads that convert consistently, and at a low customer acquisition cost.
- Have a demonstrated history in social media marketing strategy and a portfolio of work to showcase this.

We are straightforward, all we need is results. If you can get results, you'll get and keep the job as long as you would like it for!

I look forward to speaking with the right candidate soon.

Outsource Call Center Search - projects area of responsibility: portugal,Marketing,"JOB OFFER - Outsource Call Center Search - projects area of responsibility: Portugal

Help us find a call Center 

We are searching for call centers all around the world for a long term collaboration. Requirements are simple - they should be able to call to portugal and should not have like a strong foreign accent. So best case are call centers who offer the languages spoken in the mentioned countries. Second requirement is we offer just a commission based model only. Further informations in the project briefing below. 

A short summary what the collaboration for the Call Centers would be about:

It's about the truck cartel (all big truck companies) & diesel emissions scandal - The Call centers specific task is about helping/informing companies in Europe (including all Balkan countries + Turkey + UK) that they get compensation for a period of 20 years during which they bought/rented/leased trucks and cars. In that period the prices have been manipulated form the truck cartel.

The amount in dispute is now around 1.8 billion Euros, of which the call centers could receive a commission by simple informing our leads about their compensation. The great part is it is no selling, it is just informing the company. The companies themselves have zero costs and zero risks. 

We are working with 3 major companies - law firm in Munich, process pre-financier (private equity investment company from the US) and the consumer protection, on whose behalf we will act.

We already prepared a full back office with tracking, CRM and all leads, PDFs, training videos, scripts and onboarding for the call centers. Furthermore, in order to get all data, details and insights including documents of the legal decisions, an NDA has to be signed of the Call centers CEO or Director during the onboarding process. Contracts etc. will also be prepared for the Call centers CEO or Director and given to them during the process. The representative will be the only person who gets onboarded and he will manage all leads and allocate them to the call centers agents. 

You can give the call centers a quick example of how their work will look like. They will call one of our leads and just inform them of the compensation they are entitled to receive for all trucks and cars purchased/leased/rented between 1998 - 2018. For example, if the company purchased 1,000 trucks and 100 cars, with just this one lead they would receive 10 euros/truck = 10,000 euros plus 10euros/car = 1.000 euros. In average they gonna ‚close‘ 60 trucks per hour. So they can calculate their approximate commissions themselves.

They will get tens of thousands of high quality leads from us (in total we have 17 million leads that can be allocated). We think this would be very very lucrative for anyone, so that’s why we offer a commission based model only (if they are not working on commission only, please let us know right away - in that case we cannot work with them for now). Commissions are paid out within 2-4 weeks and runs automatically through their own back office. 

If a commission based model holds them back from working with us - you can offer them something else. Let's say we work with one of their agents for a week or two as a free trial phase. They can test everything, they get some of our highly qualified leads and see if it works for their company. If the trial weeks went well, they probably already made a few thousand euros. After this trial period, they can decide whether or not we want to continue with a pure commission-based model. So they can't really lose anything and they have minimal risk, except some time it takes for just one of their agents.

"Press, Events and Joint Venture Management",Marketing,"Working across two companies - Iron Cage and High Priestess (www.HighPriestess.com.au), we're looking for someone to manage media opportunities, Joint Ventures and our in-person events. 

Iron Cage is a cutting edge technology company working in the B2B sales intelligence space. 

High Priestess is Australia's largest Witchcraft Supply and Education portal (B2C). 

Leela Cosgrove is the CEO of both company's (www.leelacosgrove.com) - in working across strategically growing both of these businesses, her personal brand falls a bit by the wayside.  She is currently managing her own media and joint venture opportunities.

Gulliver Giles is the Director and head of client management and training for Iron Cage. Gulliver is well known in his industry for his dynamic presentation style, and a crucial part of Iron Cage's growth plan for 2023 is to see Gulliver speak on more stages. 

The duties we see in this role would be:

* Working with Leela and Gulliver on creating strategic marketing plans both for their personal brands and for the two company's. 

* Reaching out to media outlets. 

* Reaching out to potential Joint Venture partners (L & G are killer sales people - they're very happy to help close the deals if someone can set them up!). 

* Helping with the organisation of public events (current events on our schedule include: Witch School, the Women's Leadershp Festival, and multiple events for the Dell Women's Entrepreneur Network, which Leela is the Australian Chapter Leader of).

But we are REALLY open to you bringing ideas and feedback. 

We're specifically looking for someone with a lot of experience in these areas - we're open to higher payrates commesurate with experience. 

See, we had a conversation about training one of our current team in doing the basics - but Leela strongly felt that what we want is to bring in someone with expertise we don't have in house.

While Leela is a 15 year veteran of Digital and Social Marketing, she's aware that the focus has always been on building the company, and not her personal brand. 

Now, we're looking to work on building all four brands at once. Iron Cage, High Priestess, Leela Cosgrove and Gulliver Giles. 

We like to hire professionals and then TRUST them - so the wage and the hours we've set are a guess, and we're open to being directed to see things differently. 

We're a 100% remote company, but we do try and touch base quarterly in-person with our team in Melbourne, and it would be great to have someone who could be physically present at our larger events - so our ideal situation would be someone either Melbourne based, or someone who travels to Melbourne regularly. 

That said, our #1 Priority is to get the BEST possible person - so if that's someone based in the US, we'll make it work. 

We're happy to look at freelancers or agencies - and are open as to whether this stays as a contracting job or moves to full time.

Email Marketing and Lead Generation Help,Marketing,"I own a successful research transcription company (so think qualitative focus groups, interviews, etc. Not medical records).

I have no problem writing the emails myself, and frankly, I can use something like constant contact to send them and buy email addresses.

Need help cleaning up my internet presence.,Marketing,"Simple. As a 40 year financial advisor, one referral from over a decade ago did not pay the client back and the regulatory body FINRA, came after me for it and was total overreach. I had almost four decades in the industry without any client complaints of merit, and they spend @ $ 600,000 to take me out of the business, a professional  with no client complaints! I should not have come out that bad but they lied and lied and in the end after signing our agreement to clean up my record, they trashed me in both the complaint and bottom feeder attorneys latching on.

 I and several professionals feel the best course of action is to rebuild my reputation would be to develop a ""blog"" where clients, professionals, and friends can add both character references as well as  document their experiences and real understanding out our work together.  The truth!

For the federal government to purposely cost me my life savings, retirement, wife and kids due to their character assassination and bold face lies is unconscionable.

Further, using my accomplishments that were on top of list, back on top of each search buy burying the misrepresentations and grey matter. Rebranding!!

Finally, it would be continuous work for some period of time in order to build and keep my internet presence back at peak.

Cleanly I know very little about how to or exactly what I can do to accomplish my goal. A discussion would be in order.

-At least 3 years of in-house SEO experience, ideally for a national (non-local) business

Small professional looking landing page for consulting business,Marketing,"I'm looking for a very experienced designer for a very small job - one page long website for a newly formed consulting company. The page should be simple, but very well thought through and look professional. 

Here is the draft of the page with the texts:  
https://nbseconsultingcom-23525916.hubspotpagebuilder.com/nbse-consulting 

Few nuances to note: 

1. Most likely, people would get there through a referral - someone is going to recommend the company to a friend through a personal connection. Most of the visitors would either know me (the founder) personally, or they were recommended to work with me through someone who knows me personally. 

2. The target audience consists of the department managers from marketing operations, sales operations, or finance operations, primarily working for companies having between 300 and 1500 employees. In other words, the audience is very ""hands on"", they know the tools they work with and the exact problems they need to solve, so we should be specific in what we do, as opposed to writing general words about ""increasing the revenue and ROI"".

3.  The first goal of the page is to specify the targeting.  From the very first sight the users should see what kind of consulting we provide and see that we are doing exactly what they struggle with (see the teams, the processes, and the tools from the draft page)

4. The second goal of the page is to establish credibility. The business is new and there aren't many customers we can already put there. Due to that, we want to establish the credibility through the personal experience of the founder (me) . I have collected recommendations from people I worked with in some well known companies in the industry (Wrike, Asana, Meta) and we need to put it on the website, so that people can see my personal experience and through that trust the company. 

5. I've put the draft of the text, but I'd love to hear your feedback on how to make it better, keeping in mind the two goals - clear targeting and credibility.

6. The website doesn't need to be unique and one of kind, we won't really be closing deals through it. It just needs to look simple and professional, so that it can reenforce the idea that clients will get good quality work from our company. 

7. As a company we are also working on a product, for which we already have the website. Ideally, the company's website should have a somewhat similar style to the product's website (https://document-engine.io/). It doesn't have to be identical, but somewhat similar. 

8. The outcome of this project should be the mock-up. If you can also actually build the page on squarespace, wix, tilda, wordpress, etc - I'd be happy to give you that project as well (we'll negotiate that separately). 


Ideally I'd love to find a designer who has done websites for consulting businesses before and can recommend me how to do it right. 

I have some small design related projects from time to time, it would be amazing to find someone for the long term partnership. 

Thank you and please let me know if you have any questions!

Google & FB Ads Assistance,Marketing,"Hello! 

I recently created a website titled ""Designer Deals Daily"" (www.designerdealsdaily.com).  It is an affiliate site that provides daily deals & discounts on designer handbags and accessories - similar to an ecommerce site.  I am struggling with Facebook Ads & Google Ads (recently suspended due to counterfeit goods).  I have created a handful of FB ads that have been rejected.  I am not banned on FB Ads, but I’m sure I have some strikes on my account due to a handful of rejected ads. 

For the record, I do not sell counterfeit goods!  I'm simply a blog/deals site that connects customers with retailers that sell authentic goods.  I am a former fashion blogger & have access to LTK/RewardStyle and ShopStyle Collective affiliate accounts.  For whatever reason, my site is triggering both Facebook’s and Google’s policies, and I need some clarity as to why/how.  

I'm looking to work with someone who is an expert in Facebook & Google Ads, as I will need help with getting my Google Ads account reinstated.  Once my site is free of triggers, I will need help in creating traffic ads and ad management. 

Thank you for your time!

"Social Media & SEO Execution-- Youtube, LinkedIn, twitter",Marketing,"Let me start by getting a few things out of the way for simplicity:
1. No content creation. I create all of my own content, this job requires no content creation at all. 
2. I have a YouTube video editor and producer that I'm totally pleased with.
3. I have a website developer/designer that I'm totally pleased with, and no interest at all in redoing my website.
4. My hourly rates are placeholders -- I have no idea what the going rate for this is.

Also, if you send me a proposal that is either 100% copy-paste, or doesn't address my specifics, I'll just delete. Sorry, not being  jerk, just clear on expectations.

I'm an executive coach and leadership consultant. I have a growing (from a content perspective) YouTube channel, a podcast, and decent sized LinkedIn and twitter accounts.

You can see all here: https://linktr.ee/berchelmann (DM me if Upwork screws with the url).

I need someone who knows how to ""make it all work"" for me. I have content, I have at least a limited audience. What I need (I think) is someone to put it all together for me:
1. Grow my visibility, metrics and subscriber base, primarily in YouTube.
2. Create a plan for cross-posting, YouTube to LinkedIn and twitter to get traction, visibility, and ultimately leads.
3. Help me better understand how to manipulate SEO, mainly on YouTube, and possibly on my website (looking for advice).
4. Help me know and identify content I SHOULD be developing, whether blog posts, YouTube long-form or shorts, etc.
5. Knowledge and support in email marketing a plus.

Bottom line is, I need purpose and intentionality to be able to use my content for better recognition (leading to leads and new biz).

I'll make the hire as soon as I get the right person. If the posting is still live here, I've not made the hire and the posting is still open.

Ask questions if you have them -- I'll do my best to answer legitimate questions quickly. Before you just send the ubiquitous ""let's hop on a quick call to discuss,""   I'll likely only do that with 2-3 people tops, so please give me more to go on than just that.

Appointment Setter ,Marketing,"I'm looking for an experienced appointment setter to follow-up with leads from ads and get them scheduled for consultation calls with me. I am a public speaking coach for introverted women with public speaking fear, so the setter needs to be a woman and very approachable to relate to my clients. Actually, a little shy and awkward might be a good thing here as long as you know how to be direct when needed. 

I expect the appointment setter to come with a toolbox full of best practices for engaging warm leads and proven track record of a follow-up system that enrolls without being pushy or salesy, or annoying. However, I can provide context and edits to the script that will work for my clients. 

I'm looking for part time to start as I refine my ads and make sure we are getting quality leads.

About the project: we're looking for someone that can post 2-3 high quality posts per-week between February 27 - July 15, and perhaps after that point as well. This is the period before our launch this summer, and we'd like to start  building an inventory of content. We're open to suggestions, but we're thinking the posts could include very short insights from new academic research - culled from newspaper articles, blogs, and specific journals. Funny or witty insights into health are welcome too!

About the brand: check out BellSant.com to get a feel for what we posted last year; another version is coming out next month.  Bottom line: we're a bunch of academics, who love French style and their playfulness, and are highly experienced building innovative companies.

Copywriter: Fundraising Emails and Direct Mail for Nonprofits,Marketing,"We are looking for a copywriter with experience writing fundraising emails for nonprofit organizations, and familiar with best practices in email marketing and fundraising, to partner with a small team of freelance digital fundraising specialists. Rather than a one-off assignment, we are looking for someone who is interested in ongoing freelance writing work for a handful of national organizations with missions spanning from youth mental health, to affordable housing, to environmental conservation.

Typical writing assignments include:


-Fundraising campaigns, including 3-5 email messages and corresponding donation form and social media copy

-A newsletter with 5+ short copy blurbs recapping recent updates in a compelling way

-A donor-centric cultivation email sharing information about the organization’s impact and how the donor’s support made this work possible

-A series of “welcome” emails that are automatically triggered when a new contact signs up for email updates

-A blog post based on an interview with a staff member or beneficiary about a new program

-Direct mail copy that ranges from 600-800 words


Our work is fast-paced, and the ideal candidate would have regular availability to turn around  emails within 1-2 days, or a longer assignment (e.g. a multi-email campaign or direct mail piece) within 1-2 weeks. 

If this sounds like a good fit for you, please send us some information about your relevant experience along with work samples. 

Looking forward to hearing from you!

A bit about us... Helm exists to free people and their potential.

In our work together, you'll doubtless discover both limitations and all that you need to catapult yourself beyond those limitations.

As a teenager, I discovered a near-paralyzing fear I had of public speaking when I was asked to give a talk. Years later, a communication coach shifted my paradigm. Soon after, I escaped my incapacitating dread and grew to love speaking.

What are your limitations? Some you may know. Some may be invisible. It's said that the worst prison is the one you don't know you're in. Elephants are born in parts of the world tethered to a stake in the ground and don't travel outside a 10-foot radius. By 1 year old, the elephant can snap the stake like a toothpick but it doesn't because it's been conditioned.

A big part of Helm is discovering our ""growing edge"" - the next realm of growth. And a big part of what animates our team at Helm is elevating each other beyond our conditioning and revealing the potential each of us has. But that is the only part.

Inspired by my own transformation, I spent over 20 years coaching individuals and organizations to break free from their limitations. While liberating, I learned that focusing just on success in my life or just ""within the four walls of my business"" isn't enough. And for one simple reason: freedom outside ""our four walls"" is vanishing and robbing us of our personal freedoms.

Threats to our freedom take many forms but they share 1 key feature: aggression. The core of my philosophy is the non-aggression principle: live and let live. Each of us should be in charge of our body, our property, and our money. If you have in you the fight to preserve freedom and individual liberty, it's my privilege to support and empower you however I can on your journey.

When the keywords ROI starts to stretch, we’ll look at ways to get in
front of new audiences, such as paid social and YouTube, as well as
make more from your existing customer, like through email.

2 AUDIENCES

It’s nearly always your search customers who are closest to purchase.
This is about identifying and being found for your most profitable
keywords.

3 KEYWORDS

4

We conduct regular analysis on your opportunities and performance,
and serve the information to you in a monthly report. How can we be
doing better each day?

TECHNICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

- The website has over 200 URLs which are isolated, meaning they can only be accessed by a canonical.
- 460 pages only have one inbound link - which can indicate poor internal linking structure.
- Duplication appears around page titles and meta descriptions for 15+ pages.
- Missing ALT text for over 5,000 images - this can help enhance appearing for image searches.
- Meta descriptions and page titles are too long/short or missing on over 700 pages and will need optimising.

REQUIRING FURTHER INVESTIGATION

- Nearly 500 canonicals point to a different URL.
- Key attributes such as H1 being missing, too long or not viable.
- Google Search Console errors.

Page titles are written from a merchandising
perspective as opposed to SEO-focused.

- Meta descriptions are not used on all pages,
which is a missed opportunity as it allows you
to bring out key information, at the moment it
is showing as “subscribe to get special offers”
on some pages.

- The website has low content volume in key
areas such as category pages, which can help
SEO.

- There is low utilisation of quick-links within
the content body - which improves crawling
and visibility.

CREATING A MORE DIVERSE WRAP AROUND CONTENT STRATEGY, THIS COULD INCLUDE:

- Publishing specific posts and pages to answer questions that have search volume.
- Publishing buying guides which have the opportunity to rank for keywords around
the core topics.
- Creating supporting content to help increase the internal links of key products and
ranges.

COMPETITION LANDSCAPE

- Gifting guides which provide more insight than competitors.
- Insight articles such as vermeil explanation or other industry terminology.

BACKLINKS

ESTABLISHING A BACKLINK PROFILE THAT IS STABLE

- As a new website, there is an elevated risk of getting a penalty if we build out
backlinks too aggressively or incorrectly.
- Creating a slow and steady build up of a backlink profile will help accelerate the
organic visibility of the website.

COMPETITION LANDSCAPE

- By establishing straight forward and industry relevant backlinks after reviewing the
competition, it can provide us with some tactical quick wins.
- Creating content with strong value propositions will naturally attract wider backlinks
- which can also be helped along by some basic outreach.",Google Analytics,,Google Ads,Ahrefs,Google Search Console,SEMrush,Search Engine Optimization,SEO Backlinking,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,12,0,,25,35,SEO,Data Analysis and Visualization,"Python, Other"

Marketing Agency Interested In Lead Generation Campaigns,Marketing,"My objective with this post is to identify and connect with a growth-focused agency that is interested in taking on more clients. 

The day I shifted from selling marketing to delivering results, my career changed forever.  I could charge 3-5x more up front, and everything else my clients asked for turned into more revenue. 

As I write this, my business partner of three years recently let me know she was shifting her focus to spend more time with family, which I can't blame her for. 

Now, I am looking to identify a team with similar ambitions backed by a willingness to do great work and create customers for life. 

I have a well-oiled enrollment process that ensures clients pay what we ask and they pay on time. 

I love being on the front end managing client expectations and ensuring things happen on time and on budget. 

I also write copy and my track record of results dates back to 2002 when I managed several eBay stores and went on to create e-commerce stores with global reach and distribution. 

I can provide references that point to $50M in direct results produced from my campaigns. 

I would love to hear about your team, what's brought you here, and what your vision is for the future. 

In terms of a working relationship, I envision the following. 
1. Comparing and synchronizing our mutual processes. 
2. Identify a niche, create a test campaign, and run some traffic/ads. (I'm happy to contribute $)
3. Evolve our process with our first few clients and see where things go. 

Most of the results I've produced over the last few years have been in the B2B and medical appointment setting niches. 

I build something I like to call ""two-step application funnels"" and I have documented workflows and SOPs for team training etc. 

I've successfully charged as much as $30K for these builds and for simple funnels I can usually keep hard costs under $5,000. 

I typically lead strategy and write the core campaign copy.  I rely on designers, page builders, and video editors for assembly under my direction. 

No platform I have found (in doing this for almost 20 years) compares to what High Level can provide as an all-in-one funnel/CRM solution, but I'm also open to whatever your workflows and experiences have yielded.  

The video below is to give you a little more insight into my blueprint and vision. 

Let's talk soon.

Need a good digital marketing person/company to help us with our SaaS,Marketing,"READ THE ENTIRE JOB POSTING. If you simply write back that you are a Facebook Ads manager... do not apply.

We need someone with vast knowledge of digital marketing for AccountSend.com 

We need someone to help us get the company out there to start generating serious revenue.

We have a small budget for testing... the testing phase must yield tangible results to increase the budget. We do not have $10,000 to spend on Facebook ads to test... I've no interest in that. We've spent $25,000 on Facebook ads and barely broke even The cost per acquisition on Facebook has become outlandishly ridiculously high. So, if you are going to propose Facebook ads.... please do not apply.  We've had 10 other firms try to manage our Facebook Ads account and they all failed. I've heard EVERY strategy in the world... NOTHING works.

We need a strategy that will work, is cheap to test, and can yield results. We have all the data we can use such as email and mobile phones. Again, do not simply write back ""we can run an email campaign via mailchimp"".... we can do that ourselves... and mailchimp will shut it down immediately

We need a comprehensive cover letter explaining what you actually can do for us with DETAIL.
