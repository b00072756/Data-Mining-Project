Case Study (on-demand delivery startup),https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Case-Study-demand-delivery-startup_~01a68fe11935206388/,Intermediate,,Data_science,5 minutes ago,"Hi,

Would you be able to help me do a case-study this Saturday around 2PM EST? It will take up to 3 hours.

It will require Excel or Sheets, and maybe a little bit of SQL/Python, but I think Excel/Sheets will suffice.

The Case Study will be on a business problem for a tech on-demand delivery startup, and the objective of the Case Study is to to break down a complex problem and present the information in a clear, concise and structured manner. 

How we will do it: We can get on a Google Meet call, and I will share my screen with you. You will guide me live on how to complete it. 

Please let me know if you can do it, and we can talk further.

Bonus if you have previously worked at Uber/DoorDash/Instacart etc. in an Operations Manager role, but it's not necessary.",https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626742065250304,Google Data Studio,Google Data Studio,https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626782364123136,SQL,https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626784704544768,Tableau,https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626758615973888,Microsoft Excel,https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626759027015680,Microsoft PowerPoint,https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=996364628025274386,Python,https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626712596070400,Analytics,https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626793785212928,Visualization,,,Less than 5,Payment verified,,1,100.0,Canada,4.0,8.0,5.0,1.0,Fixed-price,$200 ,,0,,Business Development,Data Analysis,"SQL, Python, Other"

Your first task will be to build a Docker container with all of the required assets to get Langchain and NEOX20B working on one A100 80GB. You do not need to worry about configuring the system the container will be running on. To evaluate your capabilities we want to see if you can get Langchain working successfully with the model to do very basic things. If this is a success then we will move on to many other tasks. This is not for running in the cloud but on prem. Once your docker container is built, everything should run out of the box on the A100.",https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=1253342885165281280,Machine Learning Model,,https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=1031626755474440192,Machine Learning,https://www.upwork.com/nx/jobs/search/?ontology_skill_uid=996364628025274386,Python,,,,,,,,,,,,,Less than 5,Payment verified,,1,200000.0,Canada,6.0,12.0,4.935535593,26.0,Hourly,,$35.00-$100.00,$35.00 ,$100.00 ,API Development,DevOps and CI/CD,"Docker, Other"
